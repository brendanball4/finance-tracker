# finance-tracker

A personal finance tracking API that helps me keep tabs on where my money goes. Nothing fancy, just a way to upload transactions (manually or from bank statements) and actually see what's happening with my spending.

## What it does

- Upload transactions manually or import from bank statements
- View graphs, charts, and data visualizations of spending patterns
- Track expenses across different categories
- Get insights into spending habits

## Future plans

Eventually want to add smart recommendations to help conserve money in certain areas. Think "hey, you're spending way too much on coffee" or "maybe cut back on those impulse Amazon purchases."

## Getting started

Still setting this up, but it'll be a C# REST API that you can hit with requests to manage your financial data.

*Built because I got tired of not knowing where my money actually goes.*
